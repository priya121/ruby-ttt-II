Ruby TicTacToe II

A cleaner version of a **TicTacToe** written during my apprenticeship.

There are 5 options :

1. Human vs Human
2. Human vs Computer
3. Computer vs Human
4. Computer vs Computer
5. Exit

The computer player is an unbeatable computer player that uses negamax to calculate its next move.

In order to play clone the repo:  `git@github.com:priya121/TicTacToe.git`

Then run the following command: `ruby bin/ttt.rb
